*(Previously known as Bitcoin-Standup-macOS.)*

**_GordianServer-macOS_** is a open source project and a suite of tools that helps users to install a [Bitcoin-Core](https://bitcoin.org/) full-node on a fresh computer or VPS and to add important privacy tools like onion services. It will eventually also support optional Bitcoin-related tools like [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [C-Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora), and [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver) as well as emerging technologies like Bitcoin-based Decentralized Identifiers. *GordianServer-macOS* strives to provide the community with an easy-to-use "one-click" setup for a full node, complete with a purpose-built remote app for securely connecting to your node over Tor from anywhere in the world, providing you with a powerful suite of tools.

This tool will also harden and secure your OS to current best practices and will add sufficient system tools to support basic Bitcoin development. After setup, *GordianServer-macOS* will present a QR code and/or special URI that can be used to securely link your full-node to other devices, such as a remote desktop or a mobile phone using [Gordian Wallet 2](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8) or [Fully Noded](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fully-noded/id1436425586) on iOS.

This repo includes the *GordianServer-macOS*, which allows you to run a full node and Tor on your Mac computer.

## Additional Information

For more information on *GordianServer-macOS*:

1. [Using *GordianServer-macOS*](Docs/Using-GordianServer-macOS.md) provides basic description of functions and some FAQs.
2. [How *GordianServer-macOS* macOS Works](Docs/How-it-works.md) describes the specifics of what *GordianServer-macOS* does.
3. The [Main *Gordian* Repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSystem) contains general information on the project.

## Gordian Principles

GordianServer is primarily a wrapper to make it easy to stand up an existing server: the Bitcoin Core server. Doing so displays the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) and also links to reference apps such as [GordianWallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) to demonstrate the functionality of the entire Gordian reference architure. Our document ["Why Run a Full Node"](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Why-Full.md) describes how it does so. In short:

* **Independence.** A full node allows you to validate Bitcoin transactions.
* **Privacy.** A full node means you're not handing a full record of your transactions to someone else (and it's further protected by a Torgap).
* **Resilience.** Well-tested Bitcoin Core software, a Torgap, and a 2-of-3 multisig shared with GordianWallet all protect your funds.
* **Openness.** Bitcoin Core and Tor are both open code and they both allow interactions using open standards, such as RPC (and of course, Tor itself).

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

## Status â€” Work-in-Progress

*GordianServer-macOS* is an early **Work-In-Progress**, so that we can prototype, discover additional requirements, and get feedback from the broader Bitcoin-Core Developer Community. ***It has not yet been peer-reviewed or audited. It is not yet ready for production uses. Use at your own risk.***

## Prerequisites

- macOS 10.10 Yosemite (not yet tested on versions older then Mojave but it should work)
- ~320 GB of free space for a full mainnet node with txindex; or ~30 GB for a full testnet3 node; or substantially less if the full node is pruned.
- In order to install *Bitcoin Core* and *Tor* on your behalf, *GordianServer-macOS* uses *Brew* and *XCode Command Line Tools*, these will be automatically downloaded and installed for you within the app using a popular well reviewed open sourced script called *Strap*, you can read more about *Strap* [here](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/blob/master/README.md). In addition to installing *Brew* and *XCode Command Line Tools*, *Strap* also sets up your Macbook for best security practices; including full disc encryption with *FileVault*, enables *macOS Firewall* and disables *Java* for better security among others.

## Installation Instructions

You must meet minimum OS and space requirements to install *GordianServer-macOS* on your Mac, as described below.     

- minimum macOS 10.10 Yosemite (not yet tested on versions older then Mojave but it should work)
- Navigate to [Tagged release page v0.1.5](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v0.1.5)
- Click to download `GordianServer-macOS-v0.1.5.dmg`
- Double click the downloaded `GordianServer-macOS-v0.1.5.dmg` file. That's it.

`GordianServer-macOS-v0.1.5.dmg` has been pgp signed, the pgp signature can be viewed. It is on the [same release page](./releases/tag/v0.1.5) and named `GordianServer-macOS-v0.1.5.dmg.asc`

### Build Mac App from source using Xcode

Instead of downloading binaries through our Github repo, you can build *GordianServer-macOS* by hand using Apple's *Xcode*.

1. Install [*Xcode*](https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
2.  [Create](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) a free Apple developer account.
3. Link your GitHub account
   - In *Xcode*, click "Xcode" > "preferences" and choose the "Accounts" tab.
   - Click "+" to link a new account.
   - Choose "GitHub".
   - Enter your GitHub credentials.
4. On [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS), click "Clone and Download" > "Open in Xcode".
   - If "Open in Xcode" does not show up as an option, try refreshing your browser's view of the GitHub repo
   - If that doesn't work, you can instead download a clone via "Source Control > Clone" within XCode.
5. When *Xcode* launches, press the "play" button in the top left.
   - If you had to download the clone by hand from within XCode, you'll likely need to navigate to the `xcodeproj` file in the `Xcode` directory.

### Warning: Old Installations

If you had an installation of Gordian Server prior to 1.0.0 it may not be fully compatible with your 1.0.0 setup. In this case, watch for any problems, particularly with Tor setup, with Bitcoin Core setup, and with RPC connections. If any such errors occur, you should ask Gordian Server to reinstall Bitcoin:

1. Use your wallet (such as Gordian Wallet or Fully Noded) to backup any private keys or to sweep funds off of Server addresses. _If you do not do this, your funds will be lost._
2. Shutdown your current network by clicking "Stop". Wait for it to finish.
3. Remove Bitcoin by going to "Settings" (the Gear) and choosing "KILL ALL".
4. Restart Gordian Server, and agree to install the newest Bitcoin.

This process will remove and reinstall Bitcoin, which will make sure any old, incompatible configuration files are removed and recreated.

### After Installation: Quick Connect

Once the app has completely installed (by either method) and once it has launched *Bitcoin Core*, you can access a *Quick Connect QR code* that can be used to securely link your full node remotely over Tor to other devices, such as the iOS application [GordianWallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) or [Fully Noded](https://fullynoded.app/). Simply choose "Quick Connect > Quick Connect" from the main menu to see the QR code.

Gordian Server allows you to run all three Bitcoin networks (`mainnet`, `testnet` and `regtest`) simultaneously via its user interface. It will present an independent *Quick Connect QR code* for each network so that you may remotely connect to and utilize each.

### After Installation: Startup

If'd you'd like your Gordian Server to start whenever your Mac does:

1. In the dock, right click on Gordian Server and choose "Options > Keep in Doc".
2. In Gordian Server, choose settings (the gear) and make sure that "Start Bitcoin on Open" is checked.

## GPG Installation instructions (Optional)

If you are planning to use Gordian Server for an operational installation, you will want to maximize your security by checking the GPG signatures of the Bitcoin server as it's installed. This requires a bit of additional work that must be done before you startup Gordian Server for the first time (whether you installed from DMG or compiled the source code).

1. Install [GPG for the Mac](https://gpgtools.org/)
   - Click on the "Download" link
   - Open the DMG
   - Double-click "Install"
   - Choose to "Continue" inside the "Inside GPG Suite" and click through additional pages
 
GPG Mail, which comes with the suite, is not required for Gordian Server Installation

### Checking Signatures

Now, when you install Gordian Server, the console will log an elongated process of finding and installing keys related to signatures. Don't worry that many are "skipped". The object is simply to collect enough public keys that you feel comfortable with the result.

When the public-key acquisition is complete, you should see a listing of good signatures. If more than a few are found you should feel comfortable:
```
SIG VERIFICATION SUCCESS:       12 GOOD SIGNATURES FOUND.
gpg: Good signature from ".0xB10C <0xb10c@gmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Andrew Chow (Official New Key) <achow101@gmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Ben Carman <benthecarman@live.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Antoine Poinsot <darosior@protonmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Duncan Dean <duncangleeddean@gmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Stephan Oeste (it) <it@oeste.de>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Michael Ford (bitcoin-otc) <fanquake@gmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Oliver Gugger <gugger@gmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Hennadii Stepanov (hebasto) <hebasto@gmail.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Jon Atack <jon@atack.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Wladimir J. van der Laan <laanwj@visucore.com>" [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from "Will Clark <will8clark@gmail.com>" [unknown]
```
The console will disappear after installation is done, so if you didn't see the final info, you can revisit it at "File > Gordian Server Log". Scroll to the bottom.

### Checking Checksums

Besides checking the signatures on Bitcoin Core, it's also helpful to check the checksums to make sure they matched.  This will appear in your Gordian Log prior to the signature check:
```
Checking sha256 checksums bitcoin-22.0-osx64.tar.gz against provided SHA256SUMS
See two hashes (they should match):
2744d199c3343b2d94faffdfb2c94d75a630ba27301a70e47b0ad30a7e0155e9
2744d199c3343b2d94faffdfb2c94d75a630ba27301a70e47b0ad30a7e0155e9
Hashes match
```
If you do _not_ install GPG, then you can still verify your checksums, but the signatures will not be checked.
